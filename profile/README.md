**Designing value in flow.**  
We explore the harmony of **Tri** (resonance, geometry, balance) and **Ava** (flow, breath, life-force) to build systems that move like nature itself — adaptive, interconnected, and alive.  

## 🔭 Focus
- Blockchain infrastructure & interoperability  
- Real-world asset (RWA) tokenization  
- AI systems designed to move in flow  
- Research, apps, and whitepapers  

## 📂 Projects
- Whitepapers (coming soon)  
- Apps (coming soon)  
- triavalabs.github.io (website hub, coming soon)
